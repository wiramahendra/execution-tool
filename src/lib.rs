//! Sandboxed tool execution for agents.
//!
//! Three tools an agent commonly needs — filesystem, shell, and HTTP —
//! each behind a policy that denies by default.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use execution_tool::{FileSystemTool, Sandbox, ToolRegistry};
//!
//! # fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//! let sandbox = Sandbox::new(["/srv/agent/workspace"])?;
//!
//! let mut tools = ToolRegistry::new();
//! tools.register(Arc::new(FileSystemTool::new(sandbox)));
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # What "sandboxed" means here, precisely
//!
//! It means each tool checks its target against an allowlist before acting:
//! paths must resolve inside a configured root, hosts must resolve to public
//! addresses, commands must be on a list. Every allowlist is empty by default,
//! so an unconfigured tool does nothing.
//!
//! It does **not** mean OS-level isolation. There is no seccomp filter, no
//! namespace, no chroot, and no separate process. A tool that gets past its
//! policy has the parent's full privileges. If you need real isolation, run
//! this inside something that provides it.
//!
//! The [`shell`] module in particular is a policy over *which binary runs*,
//! and a binary's arguments are usually enough to do anything that binary can
//! do. Read [`shell::ShellTool`] before enabling it.
//!
//! # Output is redacted by default
//!
//! Tools return a digest and a byte count rather than content. An agent
//! reading a file should not, as a side effect, copy that file into a
//! transcript, a log line, and an evidence record. Use
//! [`ToolOutcome::content`] when you actually need the bytes.
